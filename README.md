# ArcPy GIS Automation Repository

This repository contains my ArcPy scripts and GIS automation projects. I learned most of this from free online sources such as Penn State's GIS 485 programming and software development course, as well as various online tutorials.

⚠️ Work in Progress  
Many scripts are still being updated and uploaded; I will continue adding more after my exams.

## SCRIPTS
- Anime Retail Store Spatial Analysis(finished)
- Long-Term Care Facility Accessibility Analysis(finalizing)
- raster/vector processing scripts(upcoming)

This repository focuses on:
- Geoprocessing automation using ArcPy
- Spatial analysis workflows
- Raster and vector data processing
- Projection and CRS fixes
